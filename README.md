# Introduction to Python (For Finance )

### Why Python?

The increase in popularity of Python is making it the language of future technologies. 
A  predictive model on Stack Overflow [searches](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=r%2Cpython%2Cc%2B%2B%2Cjava%2Cjavascript),
 the biggest question and answer website for developers,  can tell us that Python will not only stay 
 at the top of other programming languages but might lead over consistently over the near future.
  For the first time in 2019 Python obtained more searches in stack overflow
 than any other programming language ever. If popularity is not enough for you. 
 There are many other reasons why Python is one of the most important languages
  ( or the most and at least the [one](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)) you need to know. It is easy to read and maintain, 
  have multiple programming paradigms, it is compatible with major platform and systems,
   can adopt test-driven development and many others. But the more relevant for you is the recent
    adoption by corporations and academia to develop highly scalable and maintained open-source
     libraries for Data Science. 




### What will you learn in this course?

The course is divided in two parts. In the first part you will learn the basics of the programming language.
Explore some of the essential libraries and build tools in Python for financial analysis. In the 
second part of the course you will see more advance concepts that will allow you to transform your code
into scalable and enterprise level applications. 

### Logistics:

Every class we will study and practice a topic. Each class will be divided in two sections: In the first 
section, I will introduce the main concepts and ideas. Then we will do a series of exercises together and
individually. The objective of doing exercises individually is for you to have time to ask for questions 
directly and dont miss the personal interaction when we are working virtually. During the second section,
we will review the use cases and wrap up the concepts learned in the class. At the end of the class all the
material will be uploaded to this repository

### Prerequisites:

Basic programming knowledge skills are encouraged for this course. Any previous experience using 
any scripting language or understanding of Macros will cover the pre-requisite. Coding
in R, matlab or any other statistical package will be sufficient.
